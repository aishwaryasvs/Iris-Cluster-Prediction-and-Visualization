# Iris-Cluster-Prediction-and-Visualization
The "iris-cluster-prediction-and-visualization" repo is a machine learning project that aims to predict the optimum number of clusters from the Iris dataset using unsupervised learning techniques. The repo includes data preprocessing, visualization, and clustering algorithms in Python. The resulting clusters are then visualized to provide insight into the underlying patterns in the data. The goal of this project is to help researchers and data scientists better understand the structure of the Iris dataset and to provide a tool for future analyses.
